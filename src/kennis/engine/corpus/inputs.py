"""Turning what was typed into a concrete list of files.

`corpus add` takes identifiers of several kinds - an arXiv identifier, a DOI,
a URL, a path, a `.bib` - and each collection resolves those differently. This
module handles only the part that is the same for all of them and needs
neither the network nor the corpus: deciding which *files* an argument names.

That narrowness is the design. A general "plan the whole batch first" phase
cannot work here, because resolving an arXiv identifier means fetching it and
resolving a citekey means having loaded the collection. Expanding a path or a
pattern needs neither, so it can run to completion before anything slow
starts, and everything else is left exactly where it was.

Two rules worth stating out loud:

- **Patterns are expanded here, not by the shell.** A pattern the shell
  already expanded arrives as several existing paths and passes straight
  through; one it did not arrives as a literal string and is expanded here.
  Both routes end in the same list. This is what makes the command behave the
  same way under bash, zsh and fish - which disagree about `**` - and on
  Windows, where the shell never expands arguments for a program at all. It
  also sidesteps the argument-length ceiling: a pattern naming fifteen
  thousand files is a few dozen bytes crossing into the process, where the
  expanded list is several megabytes and fails before kennis starts.
- **A pattern matching nothing is an error, never zero files.** Quietly adding
  nothing is the one outcome that looks like success and is not.
