"""Writes that an interrupt cannot leave half-done.

Two shapes, because kennis's writers come in two kinds and the wrong one does
real damage:

`replace_file` is for a file that replaces an existing one - a corpus
document, a settings file, a converged bundle file. The new bytes land in a
sibling temporary file and are renamed over the target, so a reader sees
either the old content or the new one and never a truncation. Each call stands
alone, which is what keeps a partially-finished run *resumable*: fifteen
papers fetched before a Ctrl-C are fifteen whole papers, and re-running the
command carries on from there.

`replacing_directory` is for an artefact that is only meaningful complete - a
built index. The whole directory is staged beside the target and swapped in at
the end, so the previous one keeps serving for the entire build and an
interrupt costs the work but never the index that was already there. Applying
*this* shape to a corpus fetch would be a regression rather than a fix: it
would throw away every document written before the interrupt.

Both live at the engine root because `corpus`, `rag` and `history` all write,
and a helper in any one of them that the others reached back for would close
an import loop.
